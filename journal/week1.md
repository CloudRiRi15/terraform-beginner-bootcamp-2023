# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Fixing Tags

[How to Delete Local and Remote Tags on Git](https://devconnected.com/how-to-delete-local-and-remote-tags-on-git/)

Locall delete a tag
```sh
git tag -d <tag_name>
```

Remotely delete tag

```sh
git push --delete origin tagname
```

Checkout the commit that you want to retag. Grab the sha from your Github history.

```sh
git checkout <SHA>
git tag M.M.P
git push --tags
git checkout main
```


## Root Module Structure

The root module is the top-level directory in your Terraform configuration where you define your infrastructure resources and their relationships. The root module serves as the entry point for Terraform to understand and execute your infrastructure code.

Our root module structure is as follows:

- PROJECT_ROOT
  - README.md - The root module and any nested modules **should have** README files.
  - main.tf - This is the main configuration file where you define the majority of your infrastructure resources using Terraform configuration language (HCL). You declare your resources, their attributes, and relationships here.This is the primary entrypoint where all the resources are created.
  - variables.tf - In this file, you define input variables that allow you to parameterize your infrastructure code. Input variables make your configuration more flexible by allowing you to pass values into your resources dynamically. 
  - outputs.tf - This file is used to define output values that you want to expose from your infrastructure code. Output values are useful for displaying information or sharing data between different parts of your infrastructure or even other Terraform configurations.
  - providers.tf -  This is used to specify and configure the providers you intend to use in your Terraform configuration
  - terraform.tfvars - This is an optional file where you can assign values to your input variables. It stores the data of the variables we want to load into our Terraform project.


```hcl

├──PROJECT_ROOT

├── README.md             # required for root modules
├── main.tf               # everything else
├── variables.tf          # stores the structure of input variables
├── outputs.tf            # stores our outputs
├── providers.tf          # defines required providers and their configuration
├── terraform.tfvars      # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project

```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag



### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

- TODO: document this functionality for terraform cloud

### order of terraform variables

- TODO: document which terraform variables takes presendence.

## Dealing Configuration Drift

### Terraform Import

### What Happens if we loose our state file?

if you loose your statefile, you most likely have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform import but it wont for all cloud resources. You need to check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.



### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.example`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)

[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and deletes or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps

If we run terraform plan it will attempt to put our infrastructure back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift.

### Fix using Terraformm Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure
it is recommended to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules, but you can name it whatever you like.


### Passing input variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to decalree the terraform variables.tf 

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

using the string we can import the module from various places e.g

- locally
- Github
- Terraform registry


```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It may likely prduce older code examples that coulod be deprecated. Often affecting providers.


## Working with Files.

### Fileexists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileexists

### Filemd5

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module
[Special Path Variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
}

```
## Terraform Locals

Locals allows us to define local variables.
It can be very useful when we need transform data into another format and have referenced a variable.

```tf
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "MyS3Origin"
}
```
[Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)

## Terraform Data Sources

This allows use to source data from cloud resources.

This is useful when we want to reference cloud resources without importing them.

```tf
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```
[Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

## Working with JSON

We use the jsonencode to create the json policy inline in the hcl.

```tf
> jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}
```

[jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)

### Changing the Lifecycle of Resources

[Meta Arguments Lifcycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

## Terraform Data

Plain data values such as Local Values and Input Variables don't have any side-effects to plan against and so they aren't valid in replace_triggered_by. You can use terraform_data's behavior of planning an action each time input changes to indirectly use a plain value to trigger replacement.

## Provisioners

Provisioners allow you to execute commands on compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuration Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

### Local-exec

This will execute command on the machine running the terraform commands eg. plan apply

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec

### Remote-exec

This will execute commands on a machine which you target. You will need to provide credentials such as ssh to get into the machine.

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```
